        <p>Following an invigorating and reflective year of international travel, I was inspired towards change in my career endeavors and began carving a new path in post production. I wanted to help filmmakers tell their stories and began my journey to the editing chair.

With over 10 years of experience in this field, I’ve worked in various capacities, becoming uniquely skilled in bridging the technical workflows/processes of post-production with creative storytelling. This has been especially valuable for independent films requiring a professional editor who can carry a project in both a creative and technical capacity — a highly effective editor/assistant combination.

I’d love to hear about the stories you want to bring to the screen and look forward to collaborating with you in the edit.</p>
